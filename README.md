# Turning Points Group - NASA Space Apps Project

Our goal is to engage young students with the concepts of ESG and SDGs in a creative and engaging way. To achieve this, we developed the Turning Points platform, where students will have access to a catalog of stories. In each story, they will take on the role of decision-makers, leading them to different paths and endings, demonstrating the impact our actions can have on the community and the environment. Our unique features are interactivity, protagonism, and the possibility of including various stories created from different perspectives, addressing the 17 SDGs through image and text resources. We hope that our tool will help engage thousands of students on this important topic for our planet.

## Project Overview

This project was developed in .NET Core 8 and is divided into:

- **API**: Has a Swagger interface that can assist in using the tool.
- **Frontend**: was created in Blazor.
- **Database**: The chosen database was MySQL for being a free and easy-to-use database.

During the deployment process, it is necessary to configure the appsettings files for the API and Frontend with the required data.

To start the first one, the .NET migration process can be used by accessing the API folder and executing: dotnet ef database update.
